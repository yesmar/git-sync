.Sh NAME
.Nm git-sync
.Nd recursively update git repos in directory hierarchies
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm git-sync
.Op Fl hn
.Op Ar path ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm git-sync
script automates
.Nm git
fetching and merging across arbitrarily deep directory hierarchies.
Non-option arguments passed on the command line are treated as pathnames.
.Nm git-sync
will operate on the current working directory if no pathnames were specified
at runtime.
.Pp
.Nm git-sync
recursively walks the specified directory pathnames, descending into 
.Nm git
repos and performing fetch and merge operations.  You can force a
.Nm git
repo to be skipped by creating an empty
.Dq .skip
file in the repo directory, alongside its .git subdirectory.
.Pp
.Nm git-sync
is tolerant of errors and will keep running if at all possible. Note that
authentication errors usually show up as `error 128'.  In such cases, load
the appropriate ssh keys into ssh-agent and run
.Nm git-sync
again.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ident
.It Fl h
Display usage information
.It Fl n
Disable color output (useful when redirecting to a log file)
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Update all the repos in the current directory:
.Pp
.Dl "git-sync"
.Pp
Update all of the repos under ~/src:
.Pp
.Dl "git-sync ~/src"

.Sh BUGS
.Nm Bash
may segfault when recursing massive directory hierarchies, an example being
out-of-source llvm build directories. In such cases, create an empty
.Dq .skip
file within and the offending directory will be skipped.
